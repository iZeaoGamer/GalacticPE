## GalacticPE Version 3

## This version is a major version, and includes a lot of changes.
## GalacticPE, is a upcoming network, supporting SkyBlock, Factions, and Prisons, which has custom features that you might not see on MCPE before.

## This update is huge due to that, and includes a lot of improvements, stability fixes, and scoreboard changes, query fixes, tags, and so much more!

## Version: v3.0.0 / What's new?

- Updated Scoreboard to add updated plugins, such as:

* Tags

* Rank 

* Faction updated

- Added Max Power to Pwr section.

- Updated tags to make it more professional!

- Added more tags! 50+ tags included!

- Added tags shop! You can use /tags for more information.

- Added colored rank name, rather than just the plain rank name in scoreboards.

- Updated max player list to exclude Donor slots via scoreboards.

- Updated current online player list to exclude vanished players via scoreboards.

- Updated /list.

- You can no longer be seen in /list when vanished. (Though, people with permission can see you whilst in vanish).

- Added a way to remove yourself from the query list when vanished.

- Updated some addons list.

- Added staff mode when vanished.

- Added /bm - Allows you to edit/touch a protected area. Means build mode. Credits to @Owner | BigDisrespect for the idea!

- Added all ranks to the database!

- Owner is now multi-coloured! How awesome is that?

- You now have an option to use the Target a player item to either teleport to any random online players, or let it open a UI so you can choose which player to teleport to!

- Use Target A Player item to teleport to a random/select a player.

- Added new donor ranks to the GalacticPE server.

- Changed the way moderation management works.

- We've added 5 new items to vanish (As staff mode).

1. Target A Player - We've changed that massively. You can target players in two ways!
* Target a randomised online player, which will randomly teleport to any online player.

* Select a list of players online using a form.

2.  Freeze A player - Hit the specific user to freeze/unfreeze a player.

3. Random Target Teleporter - Toggle on/off online player teleporting using the Target item. If turned on, you can randomly teleport to a random online player. If turned off, the Target player item will show a form UI of selections of whoever you want to target.

4. InventorySee - You can check for other player's inventories, by hitting them! Of course though, this does come with availability of what you can and want to do. Depending whichever mode / option you select, you can open their player inventory or their ender chest inventory.

5. Inventory Type - By default, it's set to Player Inventory. If turned to Player Inventory, once damaged a player, it'll open their personal inventory (Player Inventory). If turned to Ender Chest Inventory, when you next damage a target player, you can see their ender chest inventory.

- Fixed Ice item from being place-able when in vanish.

- We've finally created our own area/world protection plugin and messages!

- Currently there's no available way of being able to create, edit, and delete a area. This is all done through coding. We may add support for in-game compatibility in the future.

- Added BuildMode support.

- Added /bm = buildmode to the server! How this works:
When you type /bm on, this means you can bypass area protections. You can break, and place any blocks, but the cache is you won't be able to drop any items. You will also be put in creative mode for obvious reasons. To disable this however, use /bm off.

- Added new world edit system

- We're now using a completely, updated, and brand new worldedit plugin that somewhat still works! 

- Added a new permission node: *. This permission node is very Overpowering. This permission will allow you to gain access to every single command without operator. This permission also acts like operator. This is globally, and this is very useful for if you don't want to op somebody on all servers.
