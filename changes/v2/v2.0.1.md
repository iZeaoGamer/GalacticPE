## SkyBlock Adventure

## Network / Global
- You can now have a lesser cooldown of spam by donating using this link here: http://voidminerpocket.tebex.io.
NOTE: The ranks that have lesser cooldown for spamming, are: Legendary, and Void rank. Legendary rank has a cooldown of 0.5 seconds, which is less than default. Void rank has no cooldown.
The default cooldown is 2 seconds.

- We've introduced a new restart system. How this works:

* Instead of using the proxy side plugins to automatically reconnect you to a lobby server whenever a server restarts, we're now using our own plugins for that! How awesome is that!? :D

- Auto reconnect now handles more players than before! (Untested, but should work).

- Added transferring to lobby message, when server restarts, and if the server crashes.
